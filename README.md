## Formatting Notes
Ansible relies on playbooks, which are files formatted in YAML, but those playbooks are run at the command line. 
In order to make it more clear which is which, we've tried to add the following indicators for files versus commands: 

- *üìÉ playbook.yml* = file with name and extension specified after (may also include a relative path)
- *üñ•Ô∏è at the prompt:* = yup, you guessed it, run at the prompt 
- At certain points the disctinction should be obvious, so we'll omit this when it should be clear.
